yarn setup
yarn bootstrap
```

# commands

Run a script for a package

```
yarn workspace <workspace> <script>
yarn workspace magic.iamnoah.com dev
yarn workspace @magusn/react test:lint
```

Manage a changeset

```
yarn changeset
# make changes to changeset md file
# when ready bump version of package.json and generate CHANGELOD.md
yarn changeset version
# finally create a commit with the changes and publish to npm
git commit -am "ğŸ”– (release): publish"
yarn changeset publish
# push the git tags to github
git push --follow-tags
```

NOTE: `changeset publish` assumes that last commit is the release commit. You should not commit any changes between
calling `version` and `publish`. The commands are separate to allow you to validate the release changes are correct.
