## Manage changesets for CHANGELOG and good history

The overall flow is, make changes locally, commit them and also run `yarn changeset` to generate an incremental changeset describing the changes. Eventually we may want to combine `yarn changeset` and `git commit` (see [changesets cli documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/command-line-options.md))

```
yarn changeset
# make changes to changeset md file
# when ready bump version of package.json and generate CHANGELOG.md
yarn changeset version
# finally create a commit with the changes and publish to npm
git commit -am "release(...): ðŸ”– publish"
yarn changeset publish
# push the git tags to github
git push --follow-tags
```

NOTE: `changeset publish` assumes that last commit is the release commit. You should not commit any changes between
calling `version` and `publish`. The commands are separate to allow you to validate the release changes are correct.
