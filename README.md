```

## Run a script for a package

## Manage changesets for CHANGELOG and good history

see [changesets cli documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/command-line-options.md)

The overall flow is, make changes locally, commit them and also run `mono changeset` to generate an incremental changeset describing the changes. Eventually we may want to combine `mono changeset` and `git commit`. Maybe a script that collects commit *message* first then copies to clipboard (`pbcopy`) then runs `mono changeset` ... *paste* ... `git commit -m [message]`.

```sh
mono changeset
```

Select relevant packages and semantic version bumps. Input a commit message or description of changes as summary which will be included in `CHANGELOG.md`. Then commit the changes along with the `.changeset` file.

```sh
git commit
```

Repeat above as many times as needed for any number of changes. The command below will consume `.changeset` entries to properly increment semantic versions and bump version of all `package.json` files and generate `CHANGELOG.md` entries.

```sh
mono changeset version
```

Verify things look okay (package.json, CHANGELOG.md, etc.) and commit changes with command below

```sh
mono release
```

Finally to publish changes, particularly to public modules such as `@magusn/react` or `@magusn/eslint-config-magusn` you should follow up with `mono changeset publish` which will tag and publish the releases to npm. This is required for deploys since they require pulling public dependencies from public NPM repository.

```sh
mono changeset publish
git push --follow-tags
```

NOTE: `changeset publish` assumes that last commit is the release commit. You should not commit any changes between
calling `version` and `publish`. The commands are separate to allow you to validate the release changes are correct.


# todo
- cleanup all usages of css modules (CMD+Shift+F for `.css'`)
  - verify `yarn analyze` no longer shows `styled-jsx` in `static/chunks/main-[guid].js` bundle
- remove indirection of `src/pages` and just push pages under `pages/`
- consider removing absolute and special paths (e.g. `@components`) they break vscode cmd click
- use `MagicAuth` on a test site
  - can we hit `magic.iamnoah.com/auth` routes?
  - configure as needed etc.
  - styles? how can we define and share theme values
  - can put style constants under `@magusn/react` for now?

- migrate to yarn v2 (has nice stuff like yarn dlx)
  - yarn dlx npm-check-updates
  - https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/migration

- setup husky to run on commit / push
  - lint
  - test
  - deps checks (synpack)
